Team TBD Meetings:

April 2   2:15 PM to 3:15 PM:
	All three of us were present. Damian andJustin went over what we each came up with
for Challenge 08, showed it to each other and talked about how to move forward. We decided
each of us should keep moving forward with the Lazyfoo Tutorials as much as possible still
individually.

April 10  3:00 PM to 4:00 PM:
	All three of us were present. At this point, we had all been a little busy with
The project and the challenge, so we hadn't made much progress. That being said, Damian
updated his program to turn images into textures, and Justin updated his program to 
handle the movement of an object on the screen when a key is pressed. We discussed our
plan to buckle down and put forth more time as we got done with the project and the 
challenge.

April 17  1:45 PM to 3:45 PM:
	Again, all three of us were present. At this point, Justin had managed to put
forth more time toward the project than Andrew or Damian, and had made significant 
progress, so we all collectively decided to use his program as our base starting ground
to implement more features on top of, since his program was the most cohesive amongst the
three of us. We collectively worked on the BYODS presentation during this meeting, and 
also designated tasks. Since Justin had put forth the most time, we designated Damian and
Andrew to augment the code in order to add more features such as increasing difficulty and
fixing bugs.
