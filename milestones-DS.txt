Challenge08 report:

	I didn't really get started on this challenge until later than I would have liked. At first I was
a little confused, because I could get my build (I'm using Xcode) to succeed, but I couldn't get a
window to pop up. So, I looked around and found a similar resource for learning SDL on Youtube that
helped me fix my problem. Once that was fixed, it was smooth sailing from there. I got all the way
through tutorial 4, and although my code is really just a modification of the Lazyfoo tutorials at
this point, I really feel as though I'm grasping how all this works. I'm actually having a lot of fun
learning all of this stuff.

	I noticed that my compilable task only meets one of the points on my rubric above, which is sad.
This has made me realize that I was really overshooting it for the length of only one week. I didn't
realize a week ago what all had to happen before I could even get a sprite on the board. I didn't
even think about Event Handling.

	The only concern of mine is how I feel like the Challenge writeup is a little misleading. Am I
supposed to upload my code? Am I supposed to have a total of one rubric or two? Does my time log need
to be in a seperate file? Other than that, everything is great!
